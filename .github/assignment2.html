software engineering deals with the design development and maintenance of software.
Software engineering involves a more structured and organized software development process that includes requirements engineering, design, coding, testing, and maintenance. In contrast, software development may be a less structured process that involves writing code, testing, and deploying the software.
Scrum, an Agile framework, emphasizes iterative development, team collaboration, and flexibility to change. Work is divided into sprints. Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before proceeding to the next, making it less adaptable to change.
The key difference between Agile vs. Waterfall is that Waterfall breaks down software development into isolated phases that flow into each other, while Agile advocates iterative development cycles in which multiple lifecycle phases can run in parallel.
The requirements engineering process consists of the following stages: Elicitation: In this stage, the requirements are gathered from various stakeholders such as customers, users, and domain experts. The aim is to identify the features and functionalities that the software system should provide.
Modularity in software design is a technique where complex software is divided into smaller, independent modules, such as functions, classes, or components. It facilitates easier management and understanding of complex systems by breaking them down into digestible parts.
Unit test, integration, functional test, end to end test, acceptance testing, performance testing, smoke testing, they enable for development of a proper software well tested and fixed.
Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.Git for example.
Like other types of project managers, a software project manager is the project leader with a diverse set of responsibilities, including project planning, leadership, activity monitoring, time management, budgeting, communication, risk analysis, resource management, and change management.
Software maintenance is the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs. Software maintenance is done after the product has launched for several reasons including improving the software overall, correcting issues or bugs, to boost performance, and more.
